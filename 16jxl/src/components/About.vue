      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in Nevada and moved to Caldwell in '05. I've lived here ever
        since and
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose this is the place I call home. I'll definitely relocate for
        work or if it
      </p>
      <p>means more education.</p>

      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>
        I am studying at CWI for my Associates Degree in Software Development
        and plan on graduating
      </p>
      <p>
        in Fall of 2020. I had originally intended to major in Network
        Administration, but something
      </p>
      <p>
        about Software Development seemed more interesting to me. I felt like I
        could progress more
      </p>
      <p>with Software Development.</p>
